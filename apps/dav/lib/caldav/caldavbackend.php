	 * object, based on contents of iCalendar properties, date-ranges and
	 * iCalendar component types (VTODO, VEVENT).
	 *
	 * This method should just return a list of (relative) urls that match this
	 * query.
	 *
	 * The list of filters are specified as an array. The exact array is
	 * documented by Sabre\CalDAV\CalendarQueryParser.
	 *
	 * Note that it is extremely likely that getCalendarObject for every path
	 * returned from this method will be called almost immediately after. You
	 * may want to anticipate this to speed up these requests.
	 *
	 * This method provides a default implementation, which parses *all* the
	 * iCalendar objects in the specified calendar.
	 *
	 * This default may well be good enough for personal use, and calendars
	 * that aren't very large. But if you anticipate high usage, big calendars
	 * or high loads, you are strongly adviced to optimize certain paths.
	 *
	 * The best way to do so is override this method and to optimize
	 * specifically for 'common filters'.
	 *
	 * Requests that are extremely common are:
	 *   * requests for just VEVENTS
	 *   * requests for just VTODO
	 *   * requests with a time-range-filter on either VEVENT or VTODO.
	 *
	 * ..and combinations of these requests. It may not be worth it to try to
	 * handle every possible situation and just rely on the (relatively
	 * easy to use) CalendarQueryValidator to handle the rest.
	 *
	 * Note that especially time-range-filters may be difficult to parse. A
	 * time-range filter specified on a VEVENT must for instance also handle
	 * recurrence rules correctly.
	 * A good example of how to interprete all these filters can also simply
	 * be found in Sabre\CalDAV\CalendarQueryFilter. This class is as correct
	 * as possible, so it gives you a good idea on what type of stuff you need
	 * to think of.
